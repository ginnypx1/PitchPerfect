# PitchPerfect

"Pitch Perfect" :microphone: is an iOS application developed as part of the Udacity iOS Development Nanodegree program. It uses Apple's built-in AVFoundation to allow the user to record a snippet of audio and then play it back with several different sound alteration options.

## Install

To check out my version of "Pitch Perfect":

1. Clone or download my repository:
` $ https://github.com/ginnypx1/PitchPerfect.git `

2. Enter the "PitchPerfect" directory:
` $ cd /PitchPerfect-master/ `

3. Open "PitchPerfect" in XCode:
` $ open PitchPerfect.xcodeproj `

## Instructions

"Pitch Perfect" initially presents the user with a tap to record button where they can record a small (or long, their choice really...) audio snippet.

When the user hits the stop button to end the recording, they are transferred to a screen that allows them to play the audio back with several different sound filters:

* Slow: represented by a :snail:
* Fast: represented by a :rabbit2:
* High-Pitched: represented by a :squirrel:
* Low-Pitched: represented by Darth Vader
* Echo: represented by a :bird:
* Reverb: represented by a :mega:

A user can choose to hit the back button and record a new audio snippet at any time.
